\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
\DndDropCapLine{T}{his adventure is designed as introduction to DnD}
which could be enjoyed both by beginners and experienced players.
The duration may vary depending on players' pace and experience.
During my testing with two different groups, it took around 4-6 hours to finish the adventure.
The adventure is designed for 4 players with characters of 2nd level.
Please note that this is a fan-made adventure, that serves for non-commercial use, I am the author of the characters,
the story and the maps.
The rest of the content is based on the DnD 5e rules and ForgottenRealms setting, but it can be easily adapted to other
settings and TTRPG rules


\subsection*{Adventure theme}
Sandbox urban fantasy with slight vampiric influence, following the classic conflict between criminal and ruling forces,
centred particularly on cooperative storytelling with classic elements of dungeon crawling, political intrigue, light settlement building, and exploration.

\subsection*{Narative pitch}
The group of convicts who have just served their sentence of forced labour in the metropolis of Waterdeep on the shores of the Sword Coast,
attempting to cleanse their names, pay off debts, and perhaps join the elite group of adventurers who protects the city.
However, the journey will be arduous, filled with constant conflicts between the criminal underworld and city forces.
But a new player enters the scene with a growing community vying for the position of the masked lord.
The choice is yours on whom to support to achieve your goals.

\subsection*{The tone and aim of the game}
Aim for more serious cooperative storytelling, focused more on RP than on combat.
Important thing is to have fun together.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{DndComment}{General tips to make your game more enjoyable}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule of discussion} - Everyone tries to ensure that everyone speaks for the same amount of time.
    \item \textbf{Cooperation} - DM is not playing against the players but with them.
    \item \textbf{Don't argue with DM} - If you disagree with the DM, discuss it after the game.
    \item \textbf{Do not metagame} - Do not use out-of-game knowledge in-game.
    \item \textbf{Do not cheat} - The game is about fun, not winning.
    \item \textbf{Talk in character} - It's more immersive.
    \item \textbf{Focus on the game} - take breaks if needed, set-up do-not-disturb mode.
    \item \textbf{Improvisation} - DM doesn't know everything so expect some improvisation.

Let players choose from these premade characters or create their own.
This is also an information everyone knows about each other.
If players choose to create their own characters, they should be from around Waterdeep and have been on forced labour with others.
They should have

  \subsection {Harold "Scar" of Kremle}\label{subsec:harold-"scar"-of-kremle}
\paragraph{Heavy weapons fighter}
Despite being a lyricist, he has an unusually muscular build and strong arms, almost as if the small instrument in his
hand might accidentally be crushed.
Clearly familiar with both the city and the wilderness, hard work is no stranger to him.
An ugly scar on his face gives him a rather intimidating expression more fitting for a criminal than a wandering bard,
even though his attire and rather joyous expression might suggest otherwise.

  \subsection{Yasmina}\label{subsec:yasmina}

  \paragraph{Divination Wizard}
  An enthusiastic human wizard, longing for adventure, who always wears a diadem on her forehead.
  She claims to have done forced labour because she refused a powerful lecherous nobleman, and her lawyer messed it up,
  turning her from a victim into a perpetrator.
  She seems to be very clever, not ugly either, and moves as gracefully as a cat, but they've never entrusted her
  with anything heavier than a broom.
  She is knowledgeable in history and magic and has occasionally saved someone from injury thanks to her visions.

  \subsection{Silgrid Coalbraid}\label{subsec:silgrid-coalbraid}

  \paragraph{Dwarven rogue} A trusting, devout dwarf with a dark metal collar.
  She exudes compassion and understanding, but she might be a bit of a weirdo; I feel like she experiences other
  people's emotions too intensely.
  Unlike other dwarves, she's rather small and slender, probably wouldn't last long
  in the mines, but she moves quickly and has a good aim.
  She often discreetly prays in dark alleys when nobody's looking.
  She always wears a dark clothes, and despite all her strange quirks, she's quite easy to talk to.

  \subsection{Sally “Jackdaw” Horst}\label{subsec:sally-jackdaw-horst}

  \paragraph{Kenku ranger, druid fighting style}
  A secretive grey-black Kenku rumoured to have once been part of the city watch.
  Unable to speak, only mimics other voices and sounds.
  Not very strong, which isn't unusual for a bird-like race.
  Appears to act with caution and not be overly swayed by emotions.
  Moves calmly and carefully observes the surroundings, alert to every rustle.
  Seems to have a grasp of nature and remains unfazed by anything in the city.
  He values morality highly and despises all criminal activities.

Harold was born in the forest village of Kremle, to a hunter's wife.
He spent most of his childhood in the woods with his father, who taught him everything about nature, survival, and hunting.
In his teens, he yearned to experience life in the city, which his father so despised.
He spent much time in the taverns of the nearby small town of Grapewade,
where he unsuccessfully tried to perform as a solo lyrist, hoping to travel the world as a wandering bard.
Due to criticism in the tavern, he often got into fights, and once he got hit by a broken bottle to the face.
Since then, they called him nothing but "Scar".
Despite not being naturally endowed with beauty or charisma, he ventured into the metropolis of Waterdeep, after a
quarrel with his Firbolg girlfriend, from whom he learned the language of giants.
In Waterdeep, he failed as a bard, and to make a living, he started doing what he knew best - hunting.
He lived in the city and hunted people or other beings, spending his free time in taverns or with esteemed music teachers.
After being tricked by his rival, a human bounty hunter named Ray Cox, into kidnapping an innocent woman and
being reported to the guards, Harold was sentenced to a year of hard labour and a ban on bounty hunting.
Now, after serving his sentence, Harold longs to rid himself of that dirty trade finally, and the only more
lucrative option to afford teachers and finally achieve fame as a musician is to become an adventurer.
\subsubsection{Secrets}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item He conceals his past as a bounty hunter
    \item He was pretending to be a musician, although he was not very good at it (even after years, he still made mistakes).
    \item He certainly lacks bardic abilities but tries to socialise as a typical bard would.

Born as an unwanted child of a sea elf mercenary and a human sorceress who studied marine magical phenomena on the
island of Mintarn near the Sword Coast.
Shortly after birth, her father disowned her, and with her mother, she sailed
to Neverwinter, where she spent most of her childhood.\\
Her mother was ashamed of her romance with Yasmina's father, so she disguised her daughter.
To conceal her origin, she created an enchanted diadem that adjusted the shape of her ears, concealed her gills,
and changed the colour of her skin from green-blue to a human fair complexion.\\
Magic ran in her blood, and she learned everything she could from her mother and later from private tutors at the
House of Knowledge.
Because of her mother's influence, she distrusted men, especially elves, travellers, adventurers, and mercenaries.\\
Her talent for divination magic manifested during puberty, and she began to exploit it as much as she could.
In dubious ventures, she posed as a wealthy merchant, winning bets thanks to her limited knowledge of the future.
She was exposed by an older tiefling woman named Larsa, who blackmailed her into smuggling magical items and
participating in various scams.
Before Larsa was imprisoned for organizing an illegal cult worshipping demonic forces, Yasmina managed to learn
everything from her and also express unrequited love for her.
When she confessed to her mother what she had got herself into, she was thrown out of the house.\\
Using magic and deception, Yasmina managed to acquire a wagon and a donkey and set out southward.
She read fortunes for travellers and mocked, tricked and swindled arrogant adventurers, mercenaries, or soldiers,
but tried to help the poor and women.\\
In the city of Waterdeep, she completely succumbed to her hobby of disguising and deceiving people.
She got into debt, bought all the necessary luxury clothing and accessories, forged documents, and began to impersonate
a local noblewoman to acquire her estate and a comfortable life.
In the end, she took too much risk and offended an influential man (Arnold Klinger), who uncovered her disguise.
She very unpleasantly bribed the lecherous judge Methodius, and instead of whipping and imprisonment,
she had to do forced labour for a year.\\
All she had left was a magical diadem, her personal belongings, and a hefty debt (500 gold) to a loan shark named "Goldsmith."\\
She decided to take a break from illegal activities and reluctantly admitted that the only way to make big money was
to become an adventurer.
She disguised herself as an enthusiastic wizard who craved adventure.

\subsubsection{Secrets}\label{subsec:yasmina-secrets}
\begin{itemize}
\item She conceals her fraudulent past as well as her racial identity she is ashamed of.
\item She poses as an enthusiastic wizard while, in reality, she is cynical and greedy.
\item The only ones she cares about are women in distress and the poor, but she also tries to hide that,
this might be the only thing which would make her become an honest good person.

\section{Silgrid Coalbraid}\label{sec:silgrid-coalbraid}
\subsection{Backstory}\label{subsec:silgrid-backstory}

Born in the Troll Mountains in an underground settlement of gold and shield dwarves.
The settlement often faced attacks from drow and goblins, resulting in the deaths of many of her clanmates and friends,
leading her to become apathetic and suppress all grief within herself.
She limited her contact with others and immersed herself in her destructive craft - mining alchemy.\\

The population of the settlement decreased so much that the council of elders decided to destroy the village and mines
and seek refuge in the nearby trade city of Easting.\\

Feeling lonely and full of unexpressed sorrow in a foreign city on the surface, Silgrid succumbed to the preaching and
manipulations of Nemio, the leader of the local secret sect of the goddess of loss and darkness, Shar.
In the underground hideout, she trained and served as a scout and soldier for the cult.
She prayed to forget the suffering of her clanmates and the loss of her home.
The pounding on the stone gate, calling for help, the roar of Rhûn, her love, when a horde of goblins overwhelmed him.
But blessings did not come, and she believed that only through devoted service could she gain the favour of the goddess Shar.
At the command of Nemio, she slew many, including goblins and fanatics trying to suppress freedom of worship.\\

She eventually processed her emotions and adopted a new outlook on the world.
She argued that loss is a great opportunity for a new and better beginning and that without darkness there is no light.
For her overly positive views on loss and darkness and her desire to help others cope with their loss,
she was labelled a heretic and banished.\\

Furious, Nemio, the high priestess, had her whipped as a farewell gesture left her only with a modest black garment
and placed a cursed black iron collar on her.\\

She took exile as a new beginning and an opportunity to help.
However, the curse of the collar soon manifested, and she experienced the suffering of the people she encountered in her dreams.\\

In Waterdeep, she sought ways to remove the collar.
She believed that with the help of magic, it could be done.
She had no access to mage services, so she "borrowed" a magical wand from one wizard named Forts.
However, the wand did not break the collar, and in a weak moment, Silgrid went to apologize and return the wand,
intoxicated by a strong dose of liquor.
The offended mage immediately summoned the city guard, and it wasn't long before the dwarf was performing forced labour
and had a debt of 200 gold pieces for the fine.\\

After a year of suffering, she decided to try something more honourable and decided to seek work as an adventurer
to pay off her debt and perhaps meet a mage who could help her remove the collar.\\

\subsubsection{Secrets}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Former cultist
  \item A black iron collar that cannot be removed
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The character strongly empathizes with the sorrow, suffering, and depression of characters within a 5-foot radius
  \end{itemize}
\item Worships Shar
\end{itemize}

He was born as a human into a family of a kind merchant dealing in glass and ceramics, located on the border between the
commercial and port districts of the city of Waterdeep.
When he was little, his parents took in an orphan who had tried to steal from their shop, so Sally suddenly had an
older brother.
Throughout their childhood, they engaged in innocent mischief and explored every corner of the city.\\

As Sally began perceiving criminal elements' influence on the city, he desired to change the situation.
He studied at the military academy and joined the city watch, eventually rising to the rank of investigator.\\

During the investigation of the disappearance of children in the impoverished district, he believes an unknown entity
cursed him.
He began to transform into an avian form until he appeared like a grey-black feathered Kenku.
With this transformation, he gained natural magical abilities and the natural skills of Kenkus, losing his ability
to speak.\\

After the transformation, he occasionally lost consciousness and woke up with bloody talons,
hearing a bird-like voice in his head.
He discovered that he hunted criminals at night, using his newfound skills.
When his nocturnal activities were discovered, he received a symbolic mild punishment—a year of forced labour and
expulsion from the city guard.\\

During his sentence, his brother Larry fell ill and could no longer manage his work as a merchant,
which Sally took over from his father.
Sally has a desire to help his brother and will financially support him if possible.\\

Becoming an adventurer was a clear choice for him—a chance for great wealth, doing good deeds, and the opportunity to
explore and master his animalistic self.\\

\subsubsection{Secrets}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The human investigator's origin
  \item Crimes committed on criminals, subconsciously during his uncontrolled transformation
  \item Voice in his head which he hears after losing control
  \item He believes he is cursed, but he knows very little about it
\end{itemize}
